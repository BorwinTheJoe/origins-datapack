# origins-datapack
A repository for the origins mod for minecraft.

The Datapack contains 6 new origins: Dragon, Goat, Kobold, Minotaur, Moth, and Sheep.
It also contains a recipe for crafting an orb of origins in-game.

The Datapack has been made for fabric, minecraft version 1.20.1.
It requires the following Origins addons: Apugli and Pehkui.

Apugli in this version of origin is required to enable modifying food properties and item 'edible'-ness.
Pehkui is the addon responsible for allowing character model scaling.

The Datapack has been made for me and my friends, but you are free to play with it however you like.
